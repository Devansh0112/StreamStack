# StreamStack - Web3 Video Streaming Platform

**StreamStack** is a Web3-based video streaming application built using the Stacks blockchain. It allows users to access public videos, subscribe to exclusive content with STX payments, tip content creators and commenters, and interact in a decentralized environment. This MVP aims to combine decentralized finance (DeFi) principles with video content creation and consumption, creating new possibilities for monetization and engagement.

## Features

- **Public Videos**: Access to public video content available to all users.
- **Exclusive Content**: Users can subscribe to exclusive videos by paying a fee in STX tokens.
- **User Tipping**: Tip content creators and commenters using STX tokens.
- **Stacks Wallet Integration**: Users can sign in/out with their Stacks Wallet.
- **Suggested Videos**: Display suggestions for other videos along with view and subscriber counts.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with React and styled using Bootstrap to provide a modern, responsive interface.

## Tech Stack

- **React** for the front-end framework.
- **Stacks.js** for blockchain interactions and wallet authentication.
- **Bootstrap** and **React-Bootstrap** for styling and responsive UI.
- **Clarity** smart contracts (for future enhancements, such as on-chain transactions).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- A Stacks Wallet for testing transactions
